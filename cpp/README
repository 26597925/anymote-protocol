Overview
--------

The Anymote Protocol is a messaging protocol that applications on a remote
device use to communicate with Google TV. This protocol allows developers to
write applications that enable mobile phones, tablets, or other devices to
interact with Google TV. You can write applications to enable handheld devices
to act either as fully-fledged remote TV controllers or to have some part of
an application connect to Google TV. For example, you might build an application
that runs on a mobile phone, but has the ability to switch to the TV to display
a web page.

See INSTALL for build and installation instructions.
